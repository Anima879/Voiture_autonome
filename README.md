# Voiture_autonome
Voiture autonome trèèès basique en python 

Very basic autonomous car (dot actually...) with tkinter and handmade neuroevolution algorithm
The vehicle has a heading angle (front is shown by a little arrow) and 5 rays (sensors) scatter with equal angle on 180°.
The FOV can be change in the constructor of the vehicle's class.
The number of rays can be change by changing the step in for loop in the constructor and update method (Changement is need in both)

To show the rays on each vehicle, just uncomment the 55th line in the ray file.
